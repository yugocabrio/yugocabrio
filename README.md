### Hi there 👋
I’m a freshman in Mechanical Engineering at university. Recently, I’ve been interested in cryptography, especially Zero-knowledge Proof(ZKP).
The reason is I found the beauty of the mathematical combination of Distributed Key Generation and BLS in Threshold BLS signatures a few years ago. I then continued my studies with a focus on zk-SNARKs.

After I gain some experience in the field of cryptography, I would like to concentrate on robotics at the university. Of course, I want to make synergies between those fields.

My hobby is communicating with international students to learn about their culture and improve my English.
