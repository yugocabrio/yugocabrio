### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a freshman studying Mechanical Engineering at university. Recently, I've developed an interest in cryptography, particularly in Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). This interest was sparked a few years ago when I appreciated the mathematical elegance of combining Distributed Key Generation with BLS in Threshold BLS signatures. Since then, I've continued my studies with an emphasis on zk-SNARKs.

After gaining some experience in cryptography, I aim to focus on robotics at the university. Naturally, I'm keen on creating synergy between these two fields.

As a hobby, I enjoy interacting with international students to learn about their cultures and to improve my English skills.
