### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m a freshman in Mechanical Engineering at university.

Iâ€™m interested in cryptography, especially Zero-knowledge Proof(ZKP).

I was interested in the mathematical combination of Distributed Key Generation and BLS in Threshold BLS signatures at first.

I then continued my studies with a focus on zk-SNARKs.

After I gain some experience in the field of cryptography, I would like to concentrate on robotics at the university.

Of course, I want to make synergies between those fields.

My hobby is communicating with international students to learn about their culture and improve my English.
